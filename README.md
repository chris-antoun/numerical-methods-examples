# numerical-methods-examples
This repository includes some numerical methods for integral approximation, ODEs, and function approximation. This is part of the MAT3110 course at UiO.
The methods in this repository are written in MATLAB and include:
1. Lagrange's polynomial interpolation
2. Monte Carlo's method for approximating integrals
3. Newton Cotes method for approximating functions
4. Newton's method for ODEs (ordinary differential equations)
5. Explicit Euler method for ODEs
